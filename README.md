# Prerequisites

You must install the [**Roborobo**](https://github.com/nekonaute/roborobo4/) simulator on your machine before starting. This simulator is easily installed on Linux and MacOS by following the [instructions](https://github.com/nekonaute/roborobo4/blob/main/README.md).

If you are running Windows, or if for some reason you cannot install Roborobo on your Linux or MacOS distribution, we suggest you install the Virtualbox software, and create a Ubuntu Linux virtual machine.
